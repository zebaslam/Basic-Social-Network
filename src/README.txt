Hello,
the mobile network class in the assignment will only save to a an obj file (network.obj) is the quit option is chosen in the user menu and the hash table is not null (empty). Furthermore, to ignore the case of the "keys" in the hash table, I chose to turn all the keys to uppercase immediately after taking in the user input.

Thanks,
